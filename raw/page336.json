The trigger checks a creature's initial power upon being put on the battlefield, so it will take into account counters that it enters the battlefield with and static abilities that may give it a continuous power boost once it's on the battlefield (such as the one on Glorious Anthem). After the creature is already on the battlefield, boosting its power with a spell (such as Giant Growth), activated ability, or triggered ability won't allow this ability to trigger; it's too late by then. Once the ability triggers, it will resolve no matter what the creature's power may become while the ability is on the stack."}],"foreignNames":[{"name":"古霊の踏み行く処","imageUrl":"http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?multiverseid=187091&type=card","language":"Japanese","multiverseid":187091},{"name":"先祖行迹","imageUrl":"http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?multiverseid=187340&type=card","language":"Chinese Simplified","multiverseid":187340},{"name":"Wo die Ahnen schreiten","imageUrl":"http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?multiverseid=187589&type=card","language":"German","multiverseid":187589},{"name":"Refugio de ancestros","imageUrl":"http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?multiverseid=187838&type=card","language":"Spanish","multiverseid":187838},{"name":"Onde Marcham os Anciãos","imageUrl":"http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?multiverseid=188087&type=card","language":"Portuguese (Brazil)","multiverseid":188087},{"name":"Dove Camminano Gli Antichi","imageUrl":"http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?multiverseid=188336&type=card","language":"Italian","multiverseid":188336},{"name":"Là où marchent les Anciens","imageUrl":"http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?multiverseid=188585&type=card","language":"French","multiverseid":188585},{"name":"Где Ступала Нога Древних","imageUrl":"http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?multiverseid=188834&type=card","language":"Russian","multiverseid":188834}],"printings":["ALA","C13"],"originalText":"Whenever a creature with power 5 or greater comes into play under your control, you may have Where Ancients Tread deal 5 damage to target creature or player.","originalType":"Enchantment","legalities":[{"format":"Commander","legality":"Legal"},{"format":"Legacy","legality":"Legal"},{"format":"Modern","legality":"Legal"},{"format":"Vintage","legality":"Legal"}],"id":"ea76414dcf06f1a0f03a73ef76f86c4fe4b3e539"},{"name":"Algae Gharial","manaCost":"{3}{G}","cmc":4,"colors":["Green"],"colorIdentity":["G"],"type":"Creature — Crocodile","types":["Creature"],"subtypes":["Crocodile"],"rarity":"Uncommon","set":"ALA","setName":"Shards of Alara","text":"Shroud (This creature can't be the target of spells or abilities.)\nWhenever another creature dies, you may put a +1/+1 counter on Algae Gharial.","flavor":"It lurks just under the surface, using the algae-choked tar pits of Jund as both home and hunting blind.","artist":"Michael Ryan","number":"123","power":"1","toughness":"1","layout":"normal","multiverseid":174986,"imageUrl":"http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?multiverseid=174986&type=card","foreignNames":[{"name":"藻のガリアル","imageUrl":"http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?multiverseid=187092&type=card","language":"Japanese","multiverseid":187092},{"name":"野藻长吻鳄","imageUrl":"http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?multiverseid=187341&type=card","language":"Chinese Simplified","multiverseid":187341},{"name":"Algen-Gavial","imageUrl":"http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?multiverseid=187590&type=card","language":"German","multiverseid":187590},{"name":"Gavial de algas","imageUrl":"http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?multiverseid=187839&type=card","language":"Spanish","multiverseid":187839},{"name":"Gavial das Algas","imageUrl":"http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?multiverseid=188088&type=card","language":"Portuguese (Brazil)","multiverseid":188088},{"name":"Gaviale delle Alghe","imageUrl":"http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?multiverseid=188337&type=card","language":"Italian","multiverseid":188337},{"name":"Gavial des algues","imageUrl":"http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?multiverseid=188586&type=card","language":"French","multiverseid":188586},{"name":"Водорослевый Гавиал","imageUrl":"http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?multiverseid=188835&type=card","language":"Russian","multiverseid":188835}],"printings":["ALA","MM2"],"originalText":"Shroud\nWhenever another creature is put into a graveyard from play, you may put a +1/+1 counter on Algae Gharial.","originalType":"Creature — Crocodile","legalities":[{"format":"Commander","legality":"Legal"},{"format":"Legacy","legality":"Legal"},{"format":"Modern","legality":"Legal"},{"format":"Vintage","legality":"Legal"}],"id":"2767f416361a71d4f978e82196526f4bf8ff0d3f"},{"name":"Behemoth's Herald","manaCost":"{G}","cmc":1,"colors":["Green"],"colorIdentity":["G"],"type":"Creature — Elf Shaman","types":["Creature"],"subtypes":["Elf","Shaman"],"rarity":"Uncommon","set":"ALA","setName":"Shards of Alara","text":"{2}{G}, {T}, Sacrifice a red creature, a green creature, and a white creature: Search your library for a card named Godsire and put it onto the battlefield.

For example: -- You have ten or more poison counters. Lich's Mirror doesn't remove poison counters. If you'd lose the game this way, you'll do what Lich's Mirror says, then you'll lose the game the next time state-based actions are checked. -- Your life total is 0 or less and an effect says that you can't gain life.

When you try to draw seven cards as part of Lich's Mirror's effect, you'll be unable to complete at least one of those draws and you'll lose the game the next time state-based actions are checked. -- You control *but don't own* a permanent such as Immortal Coil with a triggered ability that causes you to lose the game when a certain game state happens (also known as a \"state trigger\"), and the condition that causes the \"lose the game\" ability to trigger hasn't changed.

The state-based actions rule is trying to simultaneously (a) shuffle that creature card into your library (due to Lich's Mirror's replacement effect) and (b) put it into your graveyard.
