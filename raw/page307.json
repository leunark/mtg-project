For example, if the chosen player has five cards in hand and a spell causes that player to draw two cards then discard two cards, Nyxathid will start out as 2/2, then become 1/1, 0/0, and finally 2/2. This is because cards are always drawn one at a time, but multiple cards may be discarded at once. Although Nyxathid momentarily had 0 toughness while that spell was resolving, it isn't put into its owner's graveyard as a state-based action because state-based actions aren't checked until the spell has finished resolving."}],"foreignNames":[{"name":"Nyxathid","imageUrl":"http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?multiverseid=192282&type=card","language":"Spanish","multiverseid":192282},{"name":"Nyxathide","imageUrl":"http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?multiverseid=192427&type=card","language":"French","multiverseid":192427},{"name":"Nyxathid","imageUrl":"http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?multiverseid=192572&type=card","language":"Italian","multiverseid":192572},{"name":"夜惧妖","imageUrl":"http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?multiverseid=192717&type=card","language":"Chinese Simplified","multiverseid":192717},{"name":"Никсатид","imageUrl":"http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?multiverseid=192862&type=card","language":"Russian","multiverseid":192862},{"name":"ニクサシッド","imageUrl":"http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?multiverseid=193007&type=card","language":"Japanese","multiverseid":193007},{"name":"Nyxatide","imageUrl":"http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?multiverseid=193152&type=card","language":"German","multiverseid":193152},{"name":"Nixatide","imageUrl":"http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?multiverseid=193297&type=card","language":"Portuguese (Brazil)","multiverseid":193297}],"printings":["CON","BBD"],"originalText":"As Nyxathid comes into play, choose an opponent.\nNyxathid gets -1/-1 for each card in the chosen player's hand.","originalType":"Creature — Elemental","legalities":[{"format":"Commander","legality":"Legal"},{"format":"Legacy","legality":"Legal"},{"format":"Modern","legality":"Legal"},{"format":"Vintage","legality":"Legal"}],"id":"a41c461228677ca7c92ef065838c00027e5c1f01"},{"name":"Pestilent Kathari","manaCost":"{2}{B}","cmc":3,"colors":["Black"],"colorIdentity":["B","R"],"type":"Creature — Bird Warrior","types":["Creature"],"subtypes":["Bird","Warrior"],"rarity":"Common","set":"CON","setName":"Conflux","text":"Flying\nDeathtouch (Any amount of damage this deals to a creature is enough to destroy it.)\n{2}{R}: Pestilent Kathari gains first strike until end of turn.","artist":"Dave Kendall","number":"50","power":"1","toughness":"1","layout":"normal","multiverseid":179518,"imageUrl":"http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?multiverseid=179518&type=card","foreignNames":[{"name":"Kathari pestilente","imageUrl":"http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?multiverseid=192283&type=card","language":"Spanish","multiverseid":192283},{"name":"Kathari pestiféré","imageUrl":"http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?multiverseid=192428&type=card","language":"French","multiverseid":192428},{"name":"Kathari Appestato","imageUrl":"http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?multiverseid=192573&type=card","language":"Italian","multiverseid":192573},{"name":"瘟疫卡刹立","imageUrl":"http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?multiverseid=192718&type=card","language":"Chinese Simplified","multiverseid":192718},{"name":"Смертоносный Катари","imageUrl":"http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?multiverseid=192863&type=card","language":"Russian","multiverseid":192863},{"name":"黒死病のカターリ","imageUrl":"http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?multiverseid=193008&type=card","language":"Japanese","multiverseid":193008},{"name":"Verseuchender Kathari","imageUrl":"http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?multiverseid=193153&type=card","language":"German","multiverseid":193153},{"name":"Kathari Pestilento","imageUrl":"http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?multiverseid=193298&type=card","language":"Portuguese (Brazil)","multiverseid":193298}],"printings":["CON"],"originalText":"Flying\nDeathtouch (Whenever this creature deals damage to a creature, destroy that creature.)\n{2}{R}: Pestilent Kathari gains first strike until end of turn.","originalType":"Creature — Bird Warrior","legalities":[{"format":"Commander","legality":"Legal"},{"format":"Legacy","legality":"Legal"},{"format":"Modern","legality":"Legal"},{"format":"Vintage","legality":"Legal"}],"id":"d748929c771444996ad0d5a22d80ade01fe83e10"},{"name":"Rotting Rats","manaCost":"{1}{B}","cmc":2,"colors":["Black"],"colorIdentity":["B"],"type":"Creature — Zombie Rat","types":["Creature"],"subtypes":["Zombie","Rat"],"rarity":"Common","set":"CON","setName":"Conflux","text":"When Rotting Rats enters the battlefield, each player discards a card.\nUnearth {1}{B} ({1}{B}: Return this card from your graveyard to the battlefield.
