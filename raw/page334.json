For example, suppose your team has 8 life and you have thirty cards in your library. Your life total (being the same as your team's life total) changes from 8 life to 30 life, for a net gain of 22 life. Your team's life total becomes 30 (22 + 8)."}],"foreignNames":[{"name":"無敵の賛歌","imageUrl":"http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?multiverseid=186983&type=card","language":"Japanese","multiverseid":186983},{"name":"不屈赞歌","imageUrl":"http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?multiverseid=187232&type=card","language":"Chinese Simplified","multiverseid":187232},{"name":"Unbesiegbare Hymne","imageUrl":"http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?multiverseid=187481&type=card","language":"German","multiverseid":187481},{"name":"Himno invencible","imageUrl":"http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?multiverseid=187730&type=card","language":"Spanish","multiverseid":187730},{"name":"Hino Invencível","imageUrl":"http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?multiverseid=187979&type=card","language":"Portuguese (Brazil)","multiverseid":187979},{"name":"Inno Invincibile","imageUrl":"http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?multiverseid=188228&type=card","language":"Italian","multiverseid":188228},{"name":"Hymne invincible","imageUrl":"http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?multiverseid=188477&type=card","language":"French","multiverseid":188477},{"name":"Непобедимый Гимн","imageUrl":"http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?multiverseid=188726&type=card","language":"Russian","multiverseid":188726}],"printings":["ALA"],"originalText":"Count the number of cards in your library.
